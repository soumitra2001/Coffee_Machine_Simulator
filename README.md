Welcome to the Coffee Machine Simulator project, a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) console application that simulates the operation of a coffee machine. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts. This simulator allows users to manage a coffee machine's ingredients, sell different types of coffee, refill ingredients, check the money earned, and more.

## Introduction
The Coffee Machine Simulator is a console-based application that simulates the operation of a coffee machine. It allows users to interact with the machine by selecting and purchasing different types of coffee, checking ingredient levels, refilling ingredients, and taking earned money from the machine.

### Ingredients
The coffee machine initially starts with empty ingredient containers but can hold an infinite amount of the following ingredients:

* Water
* Milk
* Coffee Beans

### Types of Coffee
The simulator offers three types of coffee, each with its price and ingredient requirements:

#### 1. Espresso

* Price: $4/cup
* Water Needed: 250 ml/cup
* Milk Needed: 0 ml/cup
* Coffee Beans Needed: 16 g/cup

#### 2. Latte

* Price: $7/cup
* Water Needed: 350 ml/cup
* Milk Needed: 75 ml/cup
* Coffee Beans Needed: 20 g/cup

#### 3. Cappuccino

* Price: $6/cup
* Water Needed: 200 ml/cup
* Milk Needed: 100 ml/cup
* Coffee Beans Needed: 12 g/cup

## Features
The Coffee Machine Simulator offers the following features:

 * `Buy Coffee`: Users can select and purchase a coffee of their choice. The coffee will be dispensed if there are enough ingredients to make it; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

* `Fill Ingredients`: Users can refill the coffee machine's ingredients by specifying the amount of water, milk, and coffee beans to add.

* `Take Money`: Maintainers can take the money collected from coffee sales from the money box.

* `Show Ingredients`: Users can check the current levels of water, milk, and coffee beans in the coffee machine.

* `Exit`: An option to exit the simulation.

* `Analytic`s: Provides statistics on coffee sales, including the count of each coffee sold, the total amount earned, and the ingredients consumed.
